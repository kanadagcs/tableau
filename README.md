Enhancing Sales through Customer Segmentation with RFM Analysis
1. Introduction
To learn more about our consumers, we used Tableau to convert raw Excel data into five
dashboards. Our marketing plans are informed by these dashboards, which provide us with
guidance on how to effectively target various consumer segments inside the company.
The reason behind selecting RFM analysis was its capacity to precisely target customers based
on their purchasing history, segment the customer base into discrete groups for customized
marketing, and increase customer satisfaction by finding high-value categories. According to
(Singh,2023) , RFM stands for three key customer traits: Recency (R) is the number of days
since the last order or purchase, The overall quantity of orders is represented by Frequency
(F), while total sales is indicated by Monetary value (M).
Here are the RFM segments from the top customer type to the lowest, along with their
corresponding RFM scores:
1. Best Customers (RFM Score: 111)
2. Loyal Customers (RFM Score: 121)
3. Big Spenders (RFM Score: 131)
4. Almost Lost (RFM Score: 311)
5. Lost Customers (RFM Score: 411)
6. Lost Cheap Customers (RFM Score: 444)
7. Look Out Buyers (RFM Score: 222)
8. Occasional Buyers (RFM Score: 333)
9. New Customers (RFM Score: 444)
