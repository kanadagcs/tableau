Enhancing Sales through Customer Segmentation with RFM Analysis

Introduction
To learn more about our consumers, we used Tableau to convert raw Excel data into five
dashboards. Our marketing plans are informed by these dashboards, which provide us with
guidance on how to effectively target various consumer segments inside the company.
The reason behind selecting RFM analysis was its capacity to precisely target customers based
on their purchasing history, segment the customer base into discrete groups for customized
marketing, and increase customer satisfaction by finding high-value categories. According to
(Singh,2023) , RFM stands for three key customer traits: Recency (R) is the number of days
since the last order or purchase, The overall quantity of orders is represented by Frequency
(F), while total sales is indicated by Monetary value (M).
Here are the RFM segments from the top customer type to the lowest, along with their
corresponding RFM scores:
1. Best Customers (RFM Score: 111)
2. Loyal Customers (RFM Score: 121)
3. Big Spenders (RFM Score: 131)
4. Almost Lost (RFM Score: 311)
5. Lost Customers (RFM Score: 411)
6. Lost Cheap Customers (RFM Score: 444)
7. Look Out Buyers (RFM Score: 222)
8. Occasional Buyers (RFM Score: 333)
9. New Customers (RFM Score: 444)

Findings and Recommendations
Based on the analysis across the five dashboards, several key findings and recommendations
emerge: Big Spenders, characterized by their high average sales and profit, emerge as a crucial
customer segment. Targeting this group with personalized promotions and offers can drive
sales and loyalty. Customers within the Big Spenders segment show a strong affinity for
technology products like Canon Copier, Apple Smart Phone, and Nokia Smart Phone. Tailoring
discounts and marketing efforts towards these items can yield significant sales and profit
growth. Moreover, the analysis reveals a negative correlation between discounts and
profitability, indicating that while discounts may boost sales volume, they can impact profit
per order. Careful balancing of discount strategies is recommended to maximize both sales
and profitability. Exploring market bundles, especially those involving Copiers and Phones, can
lead to cross-selling and upselling opportunities to increase sales and profit margins.

Conclusion
RFM analysis-based consumer segmentation offers insightful information about various client
behaviours. By using this segmentation, the company can better engage customers and
increase sales by customizing marketing efforts to target particular client groups. It's best to
offer targeted discounts rather than general reductions on particular goods or categories that
appeal to Big Spenders. To be competitive, it is essential to regularly evaluate consumer
preferences and market changes. Long-term loyalty can be promoted by establishing trusting
bonds with Big Spenders through reward programs and first-rate customer care.
